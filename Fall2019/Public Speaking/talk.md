**(DEEP BREATH)**

A few years ago, while riding my bike to school, I was involved in a serious automobile accident. The experience changed me, and I have learned a ton about bicycle safety since then.

Hello, my name is Nick, and I am going to teach you how to ride a bike safely in a city.

I am sure everyone in here has at least thought about riding a bike as part of their commute. Get outdoors, see more of the world, maybe get some exercise.  However because riding a bike is unfortunately more dangerous then riding in a car. Its extra important to do it as safely as possible.

The first 2 tips I am going to give are about riding in general.

The first is to NEVER, EVER, listen to music while you are riding a bike. This is because the sense of hearing is immensely important, and its often the first sign of an inattentive driver.

The second pick tip is to watch out for the right of way of cars. Cars have the nasty habit of assuming bycicles have given them the right of way, even when they haven't yielded it. Unfortunately its generally safer to only take your right of way, if the driver has made eye contact with you.

For the last 3 tips I am going to tell you how to avoid common types of accidents on a bicycle.

The most common type of accident is called the right cross. The right cross is where a driver at a stop sign doesn't see a bicyclist, and continues through the intersection thinking there are no cars. Fortunately this accident can be prevented, by using the eye contact rule from before, and by driving closer to the center of the road. This makes you more visible to cars in an intersection and reduces accidents like these.

The second most common type of accident, seems comical but happens quite a lot, when you are riding next to a set of parked cars, and one of the cars opens its door in front of you and you hit the door at full speed. The solution for this is quite simple is to ride closer to the center of the road, even if there happens to be a bike lane. As a general rule if there are parked cars in the bike lane, its safer to ride with traffic then in the bike lane.

The third most common type of accident is called the wrong way wreck. It happens when you are riding on the left side of the road, and a car turns right and doesn't see you and hits you. Its super simple to prevent, just never ride on the wrong side of the road, even if its really convenient.

My name is Nick, and I have just thought you how to be safer while riding a bike.
